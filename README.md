Project 1
Virtual Pets 


Virtual Toys, Inc. wants you to build the next iteration of virtual pets to market to adults who enjoy updated versions of the toys and games they played in their youth. This game will be like the virtual pets of 1996…but so much more. It’s Virtual Pets Amok!

Our pets are organic or robotic! They are housed in a shelter and cared for by you. They have unique personalities. They can be adopted.

Virtual Toys, Inc. requires:

Development of a console application by a team that practices agile methodology, utilizes test driven design, and values clean code
Appropriate use of Git and access to your application on GitHub
Useful player instructions in the form of a README.md file
An interactive user interface
A player can enter the game, play as long as they’d like, and leave the game when they want
Player’s choice of organic or robotic pets
Ability for players to admit pets into the shelter or adopt them
Ability for players to see a list of all pets in the shelter
Ability for players to see the current status of pets, such as hunger, boredom, and health
Ability for players to interact with one pet or multiple pets, such as feed, play, and take to doctor
As players interact with pets, the pet’s status changes
REMOVE? As time ticks by, the pet's status changes
REMOVE? Players are responsible for cleaning cages
Virtual Pets, Inc. would also like the following, although it is not required:

A visual representation of the pet’s status
Give pets a personality and uniqueness, such as a favorite food, in which they respond accordingly when fed
Increase the number of statuses, activities, pets, etc.
